> Originally from [this blog post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c#.ze6c9qin1), modified to fit my usual preferences


## TODO

- Incorporate [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) for packaging. Details are [here](https://github.com/vicentedealencar/electron-with-create-react-app/commit/f1729381d588e65ac140ce5a08cc6277babd9641).
- Ensure `react-scripts` and `electron` are up-to-date
- Add basic touch bar example
